## Values

FT33 DAO is building a global, community-owned and decentralized economy around the Friend Tech ecosystem.

FT33 DAO exists to support projects that bring value to the friend tech economy. The
DAO is driven by the following values:

- Community-run
- Results-oriented
- Sustainable
- Inclusive

While we believe decentralized structures are best suited for achieving this vision,
we realize that some structure is needed to align on common goals, evaluate projects,
create accountability and ensure successful execution.
