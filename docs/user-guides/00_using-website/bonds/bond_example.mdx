# Example: How to Buy A Bond

This tutorial will be given for an FTW-ETH bond, which is a [liquidity bond](../../contracts/glossary#liquidity-bonds).
If you want to buy a reserve bond, the steps are simpler:
Simply buy the reserve asset (skip the steps in [Acquire FTW-wETH LP](#acquire-ohm-weth-lp)) and go directly to
[buying the bonds](#buy-the-bond).

## Acquire FTW-wETH LP

1. Make sure you have FTW and wETH in equal usd amounts in your wallet. For example, you can [use matcha to swap for wETH](https://matcha.xyz/markets/1/0x64aa3364f17a4d01c6f1751fd97c2bd3d7e7f1d5/0xc02aaa39b223fe8d0a0e5c4f27ead9083c756cc2) if you don't have any.

2. Head to the [bonds page](https://app.olympusdao.finance/#/bonds) of the friendtech33 website.

![Assuming an FTW-ETH bond is available, you should see it in the list of bonds](/gitbook/assets/buy-a-bond.png)

3. Click on the "Get LP" button below the FTW-ETH bond, which will take you to the page to get LP tokens in exchange for FTW and ETH.

## Buy The Bond

1. Type in the amount of assets you would like to bond, while making sure you are not trying to bond more FTW than is allowed.
   The **Max You Can Buy** field below shows the maximum amount of FTW you can purchase,
   while the **You Will Get** field tells you how many FTW you are purchasing.

2. If this is your first purchase of this type of bond, you need to approve the friendtech33 contract to spend your tokens. Click "Approve" and sign the transaction.

3. After the approval transaction is successful, the button changes to display "Bond".

4. Click "Bond" and sign the transaction. Voil√†, you have purchased your first bond!
