# Treasury

The Treasury is a key component of the friendtech33 protocol. The Treasury represents all assets owned and controlled by the protocol.

The primary responsibility of the Treasury is to steward a portflio fund of friend tech ecosystem assets & optimize for yield including the future Friend Tech airdrop.

Ensure FTW liquidity on open markets and stabilize FTW with direct market operations in certain situations. 

The treasury is comprised of reserves and FTW liquidity positions paired with DAI, wrapped friend tech keys & ecosystem partner assets, which are held in the on-chain treasury contract. friendtech33 employs a streamlined treasury management strategy with reserve assets held as DAI, soon to be DAI/DAI+ WETH/wBLT. 

A portion of treasury assets are held as Friend Tech keys in the friend.tech smart contract.
A potion is in friend tech wrapped keys currently via @0xfoobars wrapped keys contract w/ view to develop a modified version with capabilities to claim airdrops and with advanced zapping features for bonding.

In the future, additional modules can be granted access via On Chain Governance.
