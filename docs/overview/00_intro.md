# What is friendtech33 Protocol?

friendtech33 is a protocol on the Base blockchain with the goal of establishing FTW as a crypto-native friend tech asset backed reserve currency. 

It conducts autonomous and dynamic monetary policy, with market operations supported by the protocol-owned friendtech33 Treasury.



## What are reserve currencies designed to achieve?

* Deep liquidity: reserve currencies are highly liquid and can be easily exchanged for other assets, products and services
* Serve  as a unit of account: Other assets are denominated in the currency especially in liquidity pools for wrapped friend tech assets
* Preserve purchasing power: Provides its holders a stable, low volatility asset that grows at a steady rate over the medium-to- long-term.

FT33 DAOâ€™s efforts in Treasury management, development of on-chain governance structures, and prudent use of friendtech33 protocol owned liquidity and Treasury assets will help to strengthen FTW's stability to usher in the growth of the Friend Tech network economy & socialFi/DeFi ecosystem.
